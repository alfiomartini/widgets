# Widgets Collection

This is a collection of four independent _React_ applications, built on top of API's provided by _Youtube.com_, _Google.com_, _Wikipedia.org_ and _Unsplash.com_. It is comprised by a youtube video player, a translator to a pre-defined set of target languages, a panel to search for wikipedia articles, and an app to search pictures in unsplash.com using _CSS grid_ and _JavaScript_ to properly display the images. The program itself is a reconstruction/adaptation/extension of a collection of original applications developed by Stephen Grider and are (mostly) developed with React/Javascript/React-Router.
