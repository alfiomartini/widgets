# Widgets Collection

This is a collection of four independent _React_ applications, built on top of API's provided by **youtube.com, google.com, wikipedia.org** and **unsplash.com**. It is comprised by a youtube video player, a translator to a pre-defined set of target languages, a panel to search for wikipedia articles, and an app to search pictures in unsplash.com using _CSS grid_ and _JavaScript_ to properly display the images. I have used _CSS, Bootstrap, and Semantic-UI_ to style the React components. Each application is associated with an unique URL via the _React Router_ library. You can see it live [here](https://alfiomartini.github.io/widgets/).
